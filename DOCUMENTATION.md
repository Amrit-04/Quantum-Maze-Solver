# Quantum Maze Solver Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Quantum Maze Solver, a Python program that uses principles of quantum computing to explore possible paths through a simple maze. The program is built using Qiskit, a framework for quantum computing.

## Code Overview

### Modules and Libraries

- `QuantumCircuit`: A class from Qiskit to create quantum circuits.
- `Aer`: A module from Qiskit that provides backends for simulation.
- `execute`: A function from Qiskit to run quantum circuits.
- `plot_histogram`: A function from Qiskit to visualize the results of quantum experiments.

### Function: `create_maze_circuit()`

This function initializes and returns a 3-qubit quantum circuit. Each qubit corresponds to a decision point in the maze.

#### Code Breakdown

- `QuantumCircuit(3)`: Initializes a quantum circuit with 3 qubits.
- `qc.h([0, 1, 2])`: Applies Hadamard gates to all qubits, creating a superposition of all possible states (paths).
- `qc.measure_all()`: Adds measurement gates to each qubit, which are necessary to observe the final state of the qubits.

### Function: `solve_maze()`

This function creates the quantum circuit for the maze, executes it, and returns the results.

#### Code Breakdown

- `create_maze_circuit()`: Calls the previously defined function to create the quantum circuit.
- `Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')`: Selects the QASM simulator backend for executing the circuit.
- `execute(qc, simulator).result()`: Executes the circuit and collects the results.
- `result.get_counts(qc)`: Retrieves the count of each quantum state (path) observed.

### Execution and Visualization

- The script executes `solve_maze()` to get all possible paths through the maze.
- `plot_histogram(possible_paths)`: Visualizes the distribution of these paths.

## Quantum Mechanics Principles

### Superposition

Superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics where a quantum system can be in multiple states simultaneously. In the context of this program, applying Hadamard gates to qubits places them in a superposition of 0 and 1, representing all possible decisions at each point in the maze.

### Measurement

In quantum mechanics, measurement collapses a superposition to a single state. When we measure our qubits, we are effectively observing which path through the maze was taken in that particular execution of the circuit.

### Quantum Parallelism

This concept allows a quantum computer to evaluate multiple paths simultaneously due to the superposition of qubits. Our program leverages this by creating superpositions of all possible maze paths.

## Conclusion

The Quantum Maze Solver is a basic demonstration of quantum computing concepts, specifically superposition and measurement. It utilizes these principles to explore all potential paths through a simple maze represented by a quantum circuit.
